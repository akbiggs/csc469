Introduction
------------

This is a lovely introduction discussing the overall report structure, a brief explanation of the three experiments, and a hint of the magic to comr.


Part A: Benchmarking Tool
-------------------------

Describe overall goal of investigating process activity, various parameters, and context switch performance.

- Hardware: CPU family and speed, cache size, memory size, disk parameters, and other factors contributing to the test.

Part A.1: Tracking Process Activity
-----------------------------------

- Goal: Explain we want to track.

- Experiement: Explain how we plan to track the inactive periods. Explain the algorithm for finding the clock cycle speed. Explain the algorithm for finding the threshold.

- Results: Show the graphs for multiple runs. Maybe also show the found clock time and the found threshold how.

- Discussion:
  - What frequency are timer interrupts?
  - How long does it take to handle an interrupt.
  - Explain non-timer interrupts.
  - Over the period of time, how much is lost to servicing interrupts?
  - Maybe discuss the relationship with /proc/interrupts and /proc/cpuinfo
  - Where are sources of error in the data?
  
- Appendix: Reference the various scripts and files. Briefly discuss their purpose and how to run them.


Part A.2: Tracking Process Activity
-----------------------------------

- Goal: Explain that we want to find a way to measure the context switch time.

- Experiment: Explain how we started two processes that esstenially run the same part as before. We pipe the results back and compare them to calculate a context time. Explain how we process the data.

- Results: Show the plot of both threads at once. Show various best estimates for the context switch time when the number of iterations is changed.

- Discussion:
  - How long are time slices? (Before process switch?)
  - Is the length of the time slice affected by number of processes running?
  - Surprises? Compared to expectations.
  - Sources of error in the data?


Part B: Measuring NUMA Effects
------------------------------

- Goal: We want to investigate the cost of accessing a memory node from various CPUs across the NUMA architecture.

- Hardware: Briefly mention the structure of NUMA. Discuss the contents of "numactl --hardware" and discuss what we expect from the node differences.

- Experiement: Discribe the methodology used to obtain the results. Maybe mention Stream settings. Discuss how the data is processed and presented.

- Results: Show the data graphs. Show the tables. Report computations.

- Discussion:
  - Surprises?
  - Compare results to expected from "--hardware" and diagram.
  - Make note of patterns spotted.

- Appendix: A reference about what scripts are associated with each experiment, the parameters for the script, and how to run them.

Conclusion
----------

A summary of the things we learned from the assignment and the results.
