Introduction
------------

This is a lovely introduction discussing the overall report structure, a brief explanation of 
the three experiments, and a hint of the magic to come.

Part A: Benchmarking Tool
-------------------------

Describe what we are trying to measu

- Hardware: CPU family and speed, cache size, memory size, disk parameters, 

Part A.1: Tracking Process Activity
-----------------------------------

Part A.2: Tracking Process Activity
-----------------------------------

Part B: Measuring NUMA Effects
------------------------------

- Goal: We want to investigate the cost of accessing a memory node from various CPUs across the
NUMA architecture.

- Hardware:

In Non-Uniform Memory Access architecture, each set of cores has its own local
memory node. Each of these nodes are interconnected to form a single shared
physical memory. Each NUMA node is able to access its own local memory faster
than it is able to access memory in an interconnected node, due to the proximity
of its local memory.



Briefly mention the structure of NUMA. Discuss the contents of "numactl --hardware" and discuss what we expect from the node differences.

- Experiment: Discribe the methodology used to obtain the results. Maybe mention Stream settings. 
Discuss how the data is processed and presented.

- Results: Show the data graphs. Show the tables. Report computations.

- Discussion:
  - Surprises?
  - Compare results to expected from "--hardware" and diagram.
  - Make note of patterns spotted.

- Appendix: A reference about what scripts are associated with each experiment, the parameters for the script, and how to run them.

A summary of the things we learned from the assignment and the results.
